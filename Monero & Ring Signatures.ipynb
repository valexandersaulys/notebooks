    "3. Bob receives the data. He can see $rG$ and $K^o$ -- as can everybody on the network. He then calculates two equations:\n",

    "\n",
    "The private key $ k_{B}^{v} $ is called the 'view key' because anybody who has it and the public spend key can know $ K_{B}^{ls} $ for every transaction in the output of the blockchain and thus know each transaction that belongs to Bob.\n",
